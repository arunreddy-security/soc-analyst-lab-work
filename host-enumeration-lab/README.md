# 🖥️ Host Enumeration Lab

## 🎯 Objective
Perform host discovery, port scanning, and basic exploitation in a LAN using open-source tools on Linux and Windows environments.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- arp-scan
- Nmap / Zenmap
- Metasploit Framework
- Armitage GUI
- Telnet, PsExec, SSH (for exploitation)

## 🧪 What I Did
- Enumerated active hosts in the subnet using ARP scan and Nmap
- Identified OS types and open ports using Zenmap and Nmap fingerprinting
- Launched Metasploit and Armitage to exploit exposed services
- Used Telnet, PsExec, and SSH to gain unauthorized access
