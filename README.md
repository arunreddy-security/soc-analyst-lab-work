## 📌 Next Steps (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Add folders like `log-analysis`, `splunk-lab`, `malware-sim`
- [ ] Add PDF versions of reports (GitHub can't preview `.docx`)
- [ ] Add `README.md` in each lab folder
- [ ] Pin this repo to your GitHub profile

Let me know if you want me to:
- Format your other lab folders
- Add a cool `GitHub Profile README`
- Help with screenshots, project ideas, or tools setup

Ready to polish this repo to **portfolio level**? 💪
